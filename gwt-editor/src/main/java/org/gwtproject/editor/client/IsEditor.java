/**
 * Extended by view objects that wish to participate in an Editor hierarchy, but that do not
 * implement the {@link Editor} contract directly. The primary advantage of the IsEditor interface
 * is that is allows composition of behavior without the need to implement delegate methods for
 * every interface implemented by the common editor logic.
 *
 * <p>For example, an editor Widget that supports adding and removing elements from a list might
 * wish to re-use the provided {@link org.gwtproject.editor.client.adapters.ListEditor ListEditor}
 * controller. It might be roughly built as:
 *
 * <pre>
 * class MyListEditor extends Composite implements IsEditor&lt;ListEditor&lt;Foo, FooEditor&gt;&gt; {
 *   private ListEditor&lt;Foo, FooEditor&gt; controller = ListEditor.of(new FooEditorSource());
 *   public ListEditor&lt;Foo, FooEditor&gt; asEditor() {return controller;}
 *   void onAddButtonClicked() { controller.getList().add(new Foo()); }
 *   void onClearButtonClicked() { controller.getList().clear(); }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * By implementing only the one <code>asEditor()</code> method, the <code>MyListEditor</code> type
 * is able to incorporate the <code>ListEditor</code> behavior without needing to write delegate
 * methods for every method in <code>ListEditor</code>.
 *
 * <p>It is legal for a type to implement both Editor and IsEditor. In this case, the Editor
 * returned from {@link #asEditor()} will be a co-Editor of the IsEditor instance.
 *
 * @param <E> the type of Editor the view object will provide
 * @see CompositeEditor

public interface IsEditor<E extends Editor<?>> {
  /**

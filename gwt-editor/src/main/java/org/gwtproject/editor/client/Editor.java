/**
 * Describes an editor whose behavior is not altered by the value being displayed.
 *
 * <p>Editors, which may be classes or interfaces, may expose their sub-editors in one or more of
 * the following ways:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>An instance field with at least package visibility whose name exactly is the property that
 *       will be edited or <code><em>propertyName</em>Editor</code>.
 *   <li>A no-arg method with at least package visibility whose name exactly is the property that
 *       will be edited or <code><em>propertyName</em>Editor</code>.
 *   <li>The {@link Path} annotation may be used on the field or accessor method to specify a dotted
 *       path or to bypass the implicit naming convention.
 *   <li>Sub-Editors may be null. In this case, the Editor framework will ignore these sub-editors.
 * </ul>
 *
 * Any exposed field or method whose type is Editor may also use the {@link IsEditor} interface to
 * provide an Editor instance. This allows view objects to be written that can be attached to an
 * Editor hierarchy without the view directly implementing an Editor interface.
 *
 * @param <T> the type of object the editor displays.
